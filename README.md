# Caliburn.Micro.Demo
A demo of using Dapplo.Addons, Dapplo.Config and Caliburn together.

This is more or less a playground to experiment with Dapplo packages (config, language, addons) together with Caliburn Micro.
The outcome should be a new UI structure for Greenshot, where this was written for.
